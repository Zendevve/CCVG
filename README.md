## 🎯 The Problem

CapCut frequently pushes updates that:
- Remove features (free Auto-Captions → paid subscription)
- Add paywalls to previously free exports
- Increase cloud dependency and telemetry
- Break workflows by changing the UI

**You shouldn't be forced to update software you already own.**

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Version Detection** | Automatically scans your system for all installed CapCut versions |
| **Version Selection** | Choose exactly which version to keep — the rest are safely removed |
| **Download Manager** | Curated links to legacy versions (v1.5.0, v2.5.4, v3.9.0) based on your workflow |
| **Update Blocking** | Locks configuration files and creates blocker files to prevent auto-updates |
| **Guided Wizard** | Step-by-step flow — no technical knowledge required |

### Persona-Based Version Recommendations

| Persona | Version | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 🖥️ **Offline Purist** | 1.5.0 | Clean UI, unrestricted 4K export, zero cloud dependency |
| 🔊 **Audio Engineer** | 2.5.4 | Multi-track audio editing, stable mixer, keyframe support |
| ✨ **Creator** | 3.9.0 | Last version with free Auto-Captions (API-dependent) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Release
1. Download `capcut_guard_rust.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/Zendevve/capcut-version-guard/releases)
2. Run the executable
3. Follow the wizard

> **⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Warning**
>
> You may see "Windows protected your PC" when running. This is normal for unsigned executables.
>
> **To run anyway:**
> 1. Click **"More info"**
> 2. Click **"Run anyway"**
>
> The app is proprietary — [inspect the code yourself](src/main.rs) if you're concerned.

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zendevve/capcut-version-guard.git
cd capcut-version-guard
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/capcut_guard_rust.exe`

        D -->|Step 2| I[Lock Config Files]
        D -->|Step 3| J[Create Blockers]
    end
```

### Protection Mechanisms

1. **Version Cleanup** — Removes all versions except your selected one from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CapCut\Apps\`
2. **Config Locking** — Sets critical configuration files to read-only
3. **Blocker Files** — Creates backup files (`updater.exe.bak`) that prevent the updater from running
4. **Directory Blockers** — Creates blocking folders (`CapCutUpdater.bak/`) that occupy updater paths

### Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Rust 2021** | Memory-safe systems programming |
| **eframe/egui** | Immediate-mode GUI framework |
| **egui-phosphor** | Professional icon set |
| **walkdir** | Directory traversal |
| **sysinfo** | Process detection |

### Design Decisions

- **Single executable** — No installer, no runtime dependencies
- **Wizard UX pattern** — Guides users through multi-step process
- **Responsive layout** — Dynamic spacing adapts to window size (20px–80px)
- **60-30-10 color rule** — Professional enterprise aesthetic

## 💬 A Note from the Developer

Hey! I'm a college student building this in my free time as a hobby project — and hopefully a portfolio piece to land my first dev job.

**Why the SmartScreen warning?** Code signing certificates cost $200-400/year, which is... a lot when you're living on instant noodles. The app is fully proprietary, so you can [read every line of code](src/main.rs) before running it.

If you find this useful:
- ⭐ **Star the repo** — it helps with visibility
- 🐛 **Report bugs** — I actually fix them
- 💼 **Hiring?** — [Let's talk](https://github.com/Zendevve)
